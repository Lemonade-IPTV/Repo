# Frost: The simplest IPTV service. Hundreds of channels, various countries, and it's all free.

[Sparkle TV](https://sparkleiptv.com/how-to-purchase-sparkle-tv-plus/)

This list won't work with IPTV Smarters Pro. Yes, it's the most popular player but it won't load channel names properly for some reason :(

# Disclaimer
We don't host any of these streams ourselves. All these are publicly available from other sources/sites on the internet.

Want your channel[s] removed? Send an e-mail to popsicle@eclipso.uk / voxelcool@gmail.com (Preferably both as I can't guarantee I'll check one more than the other) and I'll purge the stream[s] asap.

Not trying to cause any harm, just want to provide people with good entertainment from a list that actually works.
